# Mewtagen

## How to install the packages:
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt -U

## How to use the app:
    python3 run.py

## What it does:

Mewtagen is a "smart" algorithm that takes in an incomplete Pokemon team (<6 team members) and gives suggestions for the remaining teammates.

## How it works (short version):

The app uses a "genetic algorithm" to find good ways to fill up your team.  At first, the algorithm makes a bunch of candidate teams and fills the empty spots randomly.  Then, the algorithm estimates how good each team is and decides whether it gets to "reproduce" based on its performance -- this produces a 2nd generation of teams.  The algorithm does the same thing to the 2nd generation: estimate quality of each team, simulate reproduction.

Rinse and repeat.  Over time, the population of teams should get much better in quality.

## How it works (long version):

### User Input
You tell the algorithm 2 things:
1. Which metagame you're playing
2. Which Pokemon you want to use

### Automated Input
Mewtagen then crawls Smogon's dex to grab all of the rules, allowed Pokemon, items, moves, etc. for your metagame.
It then grabs the current month's usage statistics in that metagame.
Finally, it crawls all of Smogon's analyses for movesets in your metagame.

### Genetic Algorithm

#### Overview

The goal is to get the team (chromosome) with the highest probability of winning against an arbitrary team in the metagame.

#### Definitions
..* Pokemon = dex number
..* moveset = combination of Pokemon, list of moves, ev assignments, and iv assignments
..* counter (of moveset A) = some moveset that can switch into an attack from moveset A and still beat A in an attrition battle
..* arbitrary team (of metagame M) = a team whose members are randomly sampled from the usage stats of metagame M

#### Precomputation

..* a list of counters for every moveset
..* extremely accurate Elos of arbitrary teams
..* damage calculations for all ordered pairs of movesets (attacker, defender)
..* switch damage calculations for all ordered triples of movesets (attacker, switcher, defender)
..* similarity indices between Pokemon (explained in reproduction)

#### Population Initialization

<Some number> teams are initialized by beginning with the user-inputted core and sampling the remaining teammates from the metagame.

#### Fitness Score

The fitness of a team is its estimated probability of beating an arbitrary team in the metagame.

The algorithm estimates the fitness of each team by battling it against 25 arbitrary and pre-rated teams using the Glicko system (a modified Elo skill rating system that also measures ratings deviation).  The battling system is a simple heuristic-based simulator: for every turn, both movesets attack each other with the move that will deal the most damage unless one moveset counters the other.  If moveset A counters moveset B, B will switch into a teammate that A does not counter if such a teammate exists.

Once the Glicko rating stabilizes, the algorithm computes the win probability for each team.

#### Reproduction

Elitism accounts for 10% of the the next generation -- any teams in the 90th percentile or above are copied into the next generation without any changes.

The algorithm produces the remaining 90% of candidate chromosomes in the next generation by sampling 2 parents for each from the previous generation, weighted by win probability.

#### Crossover

The child is guaranteed to have any genes (individual moveset) shared by both parents.  This trivially includes the user-inputted core.

The remaining genes in the chromosome are determined by via single-point crossover -- a random gene is selected as a crossover point.  The child inherits all genes before the crossover point from one parent and the remaining genes from the other.

##### Mutation

All genes are then subjected to the potential of mutation.

The probability of mutating from moveset A to moveset B (given that a mutation happens) is weighted by the similarity of A and B.

I defined similarity as the product (J<sub>s<sub>A</sub>,s<sub>B</sub></sub>)<sup>7</sup> * (J<sub>t<sub>A</sub>,t<sub>B</sub></sub>)<sup>4</sup>,

where J<sub>s<sub>A</sub>,s<sub>B</sub></sub> is the Jaccard similarity index of the post-ev statistics vectors of A and B
and J<sub>t<sub>A</sub>,t<sub>B</sub></sub> is the Jaccard similarity index of the defensive type effectiveness vectors of A and B.

This definition is pretty arbitrary and has no theoretical basis.  I created 9 tiers of similarity on two axes [same defensive type, similar defensive type, different defensive type] X [same build, similar build, different build], and arbitrarily said that movesets from one tier should be twice as likely as movesets from the tier below.
I then optimized the exponents to force-fit this arbitrary definition.  It works pretty well.

#### Output

The algorithm outputs the best 10 teams once the elite teams have remained unchanged for 10 generations or once the time threshold runs out.

I included some other analytical tools: (1) a listing of the most popular combinations of n Pokemon, and (2) a rough expectation of the damage output and # turns lasted for each moveset on a given team.
